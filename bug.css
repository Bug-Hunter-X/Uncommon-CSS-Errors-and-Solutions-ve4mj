The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected behavior when styles from different selectors conflict.  For example, an inline style might override a style from an embedded stylesheet, which in turn might override a style from an external stylesheet.  Incorrectly nesting selectors can also produce unintended results. A common example is accidentally applying a style to an element due to a poorly constructed parent selector or lack of proper use of the `&` symbol in nested selectors.  Another issue is using important without fully understanding the implications; overuse can lead to maintenance nightmares.
