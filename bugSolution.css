/* Solution to CSS specificity and nesting issues */

/* Instead of relying on !important, use more specific selectors to target the desired elements.  For example, if you have conflicting styles between a class and an ID, use the ID selector as it has higher specificity. */
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

/* Correctly nest selectors using the & symbol to avoid unintended style application. */
.parent {
  background-color: lightgray;
  & .child {
    color: red;
  }
}

/* Avoid unnecessary use of !important, as it can cause maintainability issues. Prioritize well-structured selectors and CSS specificity to avoid the need for !important.*/
